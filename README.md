# About
Modified version of Commando for [Pixel](https://top.gg/bot/802267523058761759), my Discord bot.

**Note:** The use of "protected" instead of "private" in `.d.ts` and `.ts` files is intentional, as `tsc` removes type
declarations of private fields, methods and constructors, which I don't want.
